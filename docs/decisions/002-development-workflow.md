# ADR-002: Development Workflow

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Need a clear development workflow from local development to production deployment. Previous PoC lacked proper staging and deployment processes.

## Decision

Implement 3-stage development workflow:

1. **Local Development**
   - Docker Compose for full stack
   - Mock data for development
   - Hot reloading for frontend/backend

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
   - Real data (subset)
   - Integration testing

3. **Production Environment**
   - Terraform-managed GCP resources
   - Automated deployment from main branch
   - Monitoring and alerting

## Rationale

- **Risk mitigation**: Catch issues in staging before production
- **Developer experience**: Fast local iteration
- **Automation**: Reduce manual deployment errors
- **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure as Code ensures consistent environments

## Implementation

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Terraform for infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Environment-specific configurations

## Consequences

- ✅ Faster development cycle
- ✅ Reduced production issues
- ✅ Consistent environments
- ❌ More initial setup complexity
- ❌ Need to maintain multiple environments
