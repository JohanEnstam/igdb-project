### **Current Capabilities**

#### **Local Development**
```bash
# Train ML model with real data
python -m data_pipeline.training.main --data data/games_clean.json --model models/recommendation_model.pkl

# Start recommendation API locally
python -m web_app.api.main

# Test recommendations via API
curl "http://localhost:8000/games/239060/recommendations?top_k=5"

# Text-based recommendations
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recommendations/text" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "space exploration adventure", "top_k": 3}'
```

#### **Docker & CI/CD**
```bash
# Run API container locally (port 8080 for Cloud Run compatibility)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 \
  gcr.io/igdb-recommendation-system/igdb-api:latest

# Check CI/CD status (all pipelines working!)
gh run list --limit 5

# View CI/CD logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# Test Cloud Storage integration
curl "http://localhost:8080/health"
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","gcs_available":"True","data_accessible":"True"}
```

#### **Cloud Storage Integration**
```bash
# Data and models are now in Cloud Storage buckets:
# - gs://igdb-recommendation-system-data (games data)
# - gs://igdb-recommendation-system-models (ML models)

# API automatically loads from Cloud Storage at startup
# Falls back to local data if GCS unavailable
```

### **Database Schema**

-- Games table with IGDB data
CREATE TABLE games (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    summary TEXT,
